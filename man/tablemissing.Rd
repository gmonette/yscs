\title{Tabulate and visualize missing values}
\usage{
tablemissing(x, sortby = "variable", bot = 6, mar = c(bot, 1, 1.5, 1),
  adj = c(0, -0.1), xpd = TRUE, srt = -60, cex = 0.8, zoom = FALSE,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the dataset to be examined. It should be of class matrix or
dataframe.}

\item{sortby}{a logical value indicating whether the variables, patterns or
both are sorted by the numbers of missing values. Possible values are
"variable" (sort by variable name), "row" (sort by pattern counts), "column"
(sort by variable counts) and "both" (sort by variable and pattern counts).}
}
\value{
\item{finaltable }{A table of class dataframe containing number of missing
values in variable and missing pattern}
}
\description{
Tabulates missing values in variables and patterns of missing values among
variables. It produces a missing value plot displaying different patterns of
missing values among variables and missing value counts.
}
\details{
This function tabulates the missing values in variables and the patterns of
missings. The input data should be of class matrix or dataframe. The
function also displays a missing value plot. Each row represents a pattern
of missings, where the variables with missing values are shown in yellow.
The barchart below shows the proportions of missing values by variable. The
barchart on the right displays the pattern frequencies. This barchart uses
the concept of censored zooming. The topmost bar, representing no missing
values in any variable, is likely to be much larger than the others and will
then not be drawn to scale, but bordered in red to show this. Ordering of
variables and patterns of missings based on counts can be very useful for
exploring the structure of missings in a dataset.
