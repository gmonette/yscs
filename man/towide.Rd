\title{Wide data set from long data set}
\usage{
towide(data, idvar = "id", timevar = "time", sep = "_")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame in 'long' form.}

\item{idvar}{(default: 'id') the variable identifying each group of rows
that are transformed to a single row in the wide file.}

\item{timevar}{(default: 'time') the variable containing the occasion names
in the long file.}

\item{sep}{(default: '_') the character(s) that separate the name of the
a time-varying variable in the long form from the added suffix for the
correponding names in wide form. Default: '_'.}

\item{...}{Other arguments are passed to \link{list("stats::reshape")}.}
}
\value{
a data frame in wide form in which each variable that varies
within levels of 'idvar' is turned into as many variables as there are
distinct values of 'timevar' using the values of 'timevar' as suffixes to
name the variables in wide form.
}
\description{
Creates a wide data frame from a long data frame identifying
an 'id' variable and using a time variable whose values
provide suffixes for time-varying variable names in wide form.
}
\details{
In contrast with reshape in stats, this function
identifies variables that
are invariant with respect to 'idvar' and does not
expand them to wide form.

Only 'time'-varying variables are expanded to wide form.

\examples{

\dontrun{
dd <- data.frame( y.a = 1:3, y.b = 1:3, x.a= 1:3, time = 1:3,
                  x.b = 11:13, x.c = 21:23, id = c('a','a','b'))
tolong(dd, sep = '.')
dl <- tolong(dd, sep = '.', timevar = "type", idvar = 'patient')
towide(dl, idvar = 'patient', timevar = 'type')
}
