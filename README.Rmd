# yscs

yscs is a collection of tools used in the Statistical Consulting Service at York University. It is a consolidation of tools developed in the 'spida' (Summer Programe in Data Analysis 2000-2012) package and other smaller packages.

You can install the latest version from github with:

    ```R
    if (packageVersion("devtools") < 1.6) {
      install.packages("devtools")
    }
    devtools::install_github("gmonette/yscs")
    ```
You may also want to install related packages:   `install.packages(c('car'))`
As more tools are ported to 'yscs', its functionality will expand. Currently, it contains the following components:

* wald and related functions: the quick and meaningful
  exploration of questions involving the linear 
  coefficients of linear models is accomplished efficiently
  using the 'general linear hypothesis'. See the help page for
  the 'wald' function.
